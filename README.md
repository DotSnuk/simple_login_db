# a(nother) simple login manager (now using database)
This is a personal project where I'm getting more comfortable with databases.

There's a few goals with this website.
- Make it look better than the previous, which worked, but looked bad too be honest.
- Getting to know HTML/CSS better (kind of relates to the previous goal)
- Learn databases, try out new things with databases.
- Try out password hashes.
